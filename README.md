---------
Two options exists to run tests, the first one is for development process and aims to practice Test Driven Development.

    $ gulp tdd

It will open a Google Chrome instance and run all tests on it, when a file is updated tests will be run again. You can see the rests as a notification or in the console.
The other option to run tests is for Continuous Integration purposes, it will run all the tests against PanthomJS and output a jUnit format file for analysis.
